## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Refactor `PlaylistTabs` to render the add playlist button within the scrollable tab container.
- [ ] 1.2 Update scroll navigation logic and spacing so the new button participates in horizontal overflow without clipping other tabs.
- [ ] 1.3 Preserve tooltip messaging and keyboard sorting guidance after layout adjustments.
- [ ] 1.4 Adjust styles or utility hooks as needed to maintain consistent visual states across breakpoints.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Exercise desktop and mobile layouts to confirm tab navigation and creation affordances remain accessible.
- [ ] 2.2 Run `npm run test` and targeted component tests to ensure no regressions in playlist tabs behavior.
