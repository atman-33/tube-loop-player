# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create data normalization utility
  - Implement DataNormalizer class with methods to normalize UserPlaylistData structures
  - Add sorting logic for playlists and items by ID for consistent ordering
  - Handle undefined title normalization to empty strings
  - Create unit tests for all normalization scenarios including edge cases
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 2. Implement deep data comparison utility
  - Create DataComparator class with areDataSetsIdentical method
  - Implement deep comparison logic for all nested properties in UserPlaylistData
  - Add performance optimization to complete comparison within 100ms
  - Write comprehensive unit tests covering identical, different, and edge case scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.5, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Create conflict analysis and resolution logic
  - Implement ConflictResolver class with analyzeConflict method
  - Add logic to determine when to auto-sync vs show modal based on data comparison
  - Implement performAutoSync method for silent cloud data synchronization
  - Create unit tests for all conflict resolution scenarios and decision paths
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 4. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Implement try-catch blocks around comparison and sync operations
  - Add timeout handling for comparison operations to prevent blocking
  - Create fallback logic to show conflict modal when auto-sync fails
  - Write unit tests for all error scenarios and fallback behaviors
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 5. Integrate intelligent conflict resolution into usePlaylistSync hook
  - Update usePlaylistSync hook to use new DataComparator and ConflictResolver
  - Replace existing conflict detection logic with intelligent comparison
  - Ensure automatic sync occurs silently without showing modal for identical data
  - Add integration tests to verify complete sync flow from detection to resolution
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 6. Add performance monitoring and optimization
  - Implement performance measurement for comparison operations
  - Add logging for auto-sync vs modal display decisions for debugging
  - Optimize comparison algorithm if performance tests show delays
  - Create performance tests to ensure 100ms comparison threshold is met
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive integration tests
  - Write integration tests for complete conflict resolution flow
  - Test scenarios with identical data, different data, and edge cases
  - Verify modal is not shown when data is identical after normalization
  - Test error handling and fallback scenarios in integration environment
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_
