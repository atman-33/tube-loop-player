# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current data conflict modal appears every time the screen updates, even when local and cloud data are identical. This creates a poor user experience with unnecessary interruptions. This feature will implement intelligent conflict detection that automatically syncs identical data and only shows the conflict resolution modal when there are actual meaningful differences between local and cloud playlist data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically sync my data when local and cloud data are identical, so that I don't see unnecessary conflict resolution modals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local and cloud playlist data are identical THEN the system SHALL automatically sync cloud data without showing the conflict modal
2. WHEN comparing data for conflicts THEN the system SHALL normalize playlist and item ordering for consistent comparison
3. WHEN comparing data for conflicts THEN the system SHALL normalize undefined titles to empty strings for consistent comparison
4. WHEN automatic sync occurs THEN the system SHALL update the local state with cloud data silently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the conflict resolution modal only when there are actual differences in my data, so that I can make informed decisions about which version to keep.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local and cloud data have different playlist names THEN the system SHALL show the conflict resolution modal
2. WHEN local and cloud data have different playlist items THEN the system SHALL show the conflict resolution modal
3. WHEN local and cloud data have different settings (loopMode, isShuffle, activePlaylistId) THEN the system SHALL show the conflict resolution modal
4. WHEN local and cloud data have different number of playlists THEN the system SHALL show the conflict resolution modal
5. WHEN local and cloud data have different number of items in any playlist THEN the system SHALL show the conflict resolution modal

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust data comparison utility that can accurately detect differences between playlist data structures, so that conflict detection is reliable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing playlist data THEN the system SHALL implement deep comparison of all nested properties
2. WHEN comparing playlist data THEN the system SHALL sort playlists by ID for consistent ordering
3. WHEN comparing playlist data THEN the system SHALL sort playlist items by ID for consistent ordering
4. WHEN comparing playlist data THEN the system SHALL handle undefined and null values consistently
5. WHEN comparing playlist data THEN the system SHALL return a boolean indicating whether data is identical

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the conflict resolution process to be fast and efficient, so that my app experience remains smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing data comparison THEN the system SHALL complete the comparison within 100ms for typical playlist sizes
2. WHEN automatic sync occurs THEN the system SHALL not cause visible UI delays or loading states
3. WHEN conflict detection runs THEN the system SHALL not block other user interactions
4. WHEN data is identical THEN the system SHALL skip modal rendering entirely

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I don't encounter errors or unexpected behavior during data synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cloud data is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL handle the case without showing conflict modal
2. WHEN local data is empty or default THEN the system SHALL handle the case without showing conflict modal
3. WHEN data comparison fails due to malformed data THEN the system SHALL fall back to showing the conflict modal
4. WHEN automatic sync fails THEN the system SHALL show the conflict modal as a fallback
5. WHEN network errors occur during sync THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without data loss
